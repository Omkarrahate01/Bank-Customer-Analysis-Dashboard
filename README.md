# Bank-Customer-Analysis-Dashboard
This project utilizes SQL and Power BI to analyze bank customer behavior. SQL is used for data extraction and transformation, while Power BI creates an interactive dashboard to visualize insights on demographics, product usage, transaction patterns, and customer segmentation, helping executives optimize retention and offerings.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to analyze and visualize key insights into bank customer behavior and trends. It provides an in-depth look at customer demographics, product usage, transaction patterns, and customer segmentation, aiming to support bank executives in data-driven decision-making.

# Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create a dashboard that:
Analyzes customer demographics (age, income, etc.) to understand behavior patterns.
Tracks various product usage by different customer.
Identifies high-value customers and monitors retention and exit patterns.
Helps in understanding which products are most and least used by different customer groups.

# Problem Statement
Banks often struggle to fully understand their customersâ€™ behaviors, spending patterns, and product usage, leading to missed opportunities for customer retention, service improvements, and profitability boosts. Without proper analysis, banks face the risk of losing customers due to unmet needs, ineffective targeting, and a lack of personalized service offerings. This project aims to address these gaps through actionable insights derived from customer data.

Dataset
The dataset includes various key features such as:
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Age, Gender, Income: Demographic information.
GeographyLocation
NumofProducts: Number and types of banking products a customer owns (loans, credit cards, savings accounts, etc.).
Credit Score: Customers credit score to identify the capability.
Exit Status: Whether the customer has exited the bank.

# Key Features
Customer Segmentation: Classifying customers into segments based on demographics, product usage.
Product Usage Analysis: Exploring which banking products are used most by which segments of customers.
Customer Retention vs. Exit Patterns: Understanding the factors leading to customer retention or exit.

# Tools and Technologies
SQL : For data extraction, processing, analysis and transformation
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Excel/CSV: For initial data preparation and structuring.
Python (optional): For advanced data processing and analysis.
DAX Functions: Used in Power BI for creating calculated fields and measures.
